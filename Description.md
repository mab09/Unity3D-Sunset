There are no premade assets used here.
The game starts with the player standing on a small walk way leading to a lookout point with two benches, on a cliff, facing the sea. Textures for all the materials that can be seen,  (1) the walkway, (2) its edges  (3) Lookout point, (4) grass, (5) rocks, (6) lamp poles and (7) heads, (8) tree trunks, (9) sea water, (10) benches are all captured by an iPhone camera in Bloomington, Indiana except for tree leaves which was created in photoshop.
You can immediately observe three particle systems: (1) Bugs on the lamp heads, (2) Fire Flies near the bushes and (3) a water spray coming in bursts from the cliff edge.
The sound sources include four different ambient sounds, having general and wind noises, also some water spray sound when close to the cliff edge. Then there are two different sounds sources for birds, there is an airplane sound and also a buzzing light sound for the lamps. There is a faint sound for crickets, this one was recorded by rotating some pebbles in a ceramic bowl, then some editing in audacity gave a somewhat convincing crickets noise.
There are four animations, an airplane, sea waves and some rotating motion for bushes and tree leaves to imitate wind movement.
